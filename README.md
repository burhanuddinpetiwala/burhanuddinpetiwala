BURHANUDDIN PETIWALA

Student at Lambton College

Ever since I was young, I have enjoyed dabbling with computers and experimenting with different applications. As I saw the great rise of the modern computing industry, I can sense that there are still tremendous developments to come in this field. I started with the first program of Hello World in Python and then trying to make myself better over it.

I am Currently Enrolled in Diploma in Computer Programming Course in Lambton College In Mississauga, Ontario, Canada
